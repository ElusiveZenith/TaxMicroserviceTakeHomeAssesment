This project was initially a code assessment for a job application. However, I got a job offer at a different company before I finished. Despite working with ASP.NET for a little over a year I didn't have anything on my portfolio using it, so I decided to finish the assessment. This project was a full start to finish project, all code was written by me with no code provided for the assessment. I have some limited prior experience with writing unit tests, but this is also my first one posted project with unit tests.
