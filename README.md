This project was initially a code assesment for a job applicaiton. However I got a job offer at a different company before I finished. Dispite working with ASP.NET for a little over a year I didn't have anything on my portfolio using it, so I decided to finish the assesment. This project was a full start to finish project, all code was writen by me with no code provided for the assesment. I have some limited prior expiriancy with writing unit tests, but this is also my first one posted project with unit tests.
